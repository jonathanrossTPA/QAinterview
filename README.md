Template for QA Automation Engineer tech interview

Thank you for investing your time in this test. Please clone the repo and work locally. When you complete your work please submit your PR for review.

**Please explore this API** - https://gorest.co.in/
There are 2 objectives in this section: 
1. Write an STP
Review the APIs and write a high level STP for the exposed endpoints.
Think of all of the major scenarios that need to be tested.
Cover those you define as higher priority.
The main entities to be tested: 
- Users 
- Posts 
- Comments 
- Todos

Make this a DOCX or TXT file and add to your branch,
The name of the file should be: _{FullName}__{Date}_QA_Automation_STP

2. Implement tests project (Write in C# or Java) and when complete (again) add to your branch
-	Follow your STP doc and implement tests accordingly
-	You will need to create a user token and use it as part of the http requests
-	Useful guidelines:
  ●	Work with models - think Object Oriented
  ●	Keep your code clean
  ●	Reuse code when possible


**We understand that covering this api is quite a general request, so please only invest as much time as you need to showcase your abilities. 
**
**In this section please answer the following three questions:**

1.	Describe at high level how what tests you would write for a smoke test for a popular web application e.g. LinkedIn, Booking.com
2.	Explain your thoughts on test strategy and how you prioritize what to automate, when and what you would leave as manual tests?
3.	What are the pros and cons of creating and running tests to run against UI at the same time as you run parallel Backend tests.

Feel free to add suggested improvements in case you’ve had sufficient time.


 Good Luck!
